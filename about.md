#### Actually
My full name is **Vsevolod Geraskin**, where the first name comes from old Russian meaning _the owner of everything_.  While my parents had big plans for me, I can never take a phrase _live up to my name_ 
quite seriously.  Simply call me **Sev**, which doesn't break your tongue and spares me from having Tsarist ambitions.

#### A bit about myself  
Born in USSR, but left Russia as a kid coming to Vancouver with my parents and sister in 1994.  Consider myself a Canadian first and foremost, but still feel affection for
my native country.  Went to high school in North Vancouver, but since made Burnaby my home.  Love travelling, reading and watching sci fi, and playing team sports, soccer in particular. Recently, became
a proud father to a healthy baby girl, who is the best thing that ever happened to me, other than my wonderful wife.

#### On a career front
Have over 10 years of software development and project leadership experience.  Recently graduated British Columbia Institute of Technology with Distinction in Bachelor of Technology in Computer Systems (Network Security Development and Distributed Systems options) 
and earned Project Management Institute PMP certification.   Recent projects include an Android application that helps vulnerable women make positive choices for their pregnancy, a proof-of-concept scalable medical records server, 
several secure communication components in use by hundreds of clients, and a multi-year conversion of several hundred organizations to the new version of Pharmanet software.

#### On the menu
This technology blog is just another leg in my never-ending journey to learn and self-improve.  Having researched and used valuable information from other blogs on my past projects, I
believe its time to do some sharing of my own. I think that blogging would help me improve my writing and social networking skills.  At the same time, if I manage to provide accurate and helpful 
articles and help someone with their work, then my goals would be achieved.  Also, please forgive me if the fonts are too distracting, but I was looking for something I could put on a side of my 
spaceship...  

...Oh yeah, and if you are still wondering what you can find on the menu here, the main course is Software Development with a side of Agile Project Management, sprinkled with spices of personal musings. 
The posts are divided into three main sections: projects, tutorials, and articles.  Hopefully, the latter two will be of some use to you, unless you are also curious about my past projects.  If you still would like to connect
after reading my ramblings, I am also on [LinkedIn](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/past5).

#### Why Past 5?
**Past 5** signifies the never ending professional journey of an Information Technology consultant, whose work is not constrained by regular office hours.  **Past 5** is also that bit of extra effort we 
sometimes need to get the job done.  Yes, I wrote that with a straight face.  Got my inspiration while clock watching.
