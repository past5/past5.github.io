excerpt: "In the last post, we asked a question of how can a small business or a consultant with limited resources and immature ad hoc processes compete with large enterprises with greater resources and
well-defined processes for large projects.  Almost always, the consultant's expertise would be the deciding factor for success.  Thus, unsurprisingly, some competitive strategies a small business can
adopt are also some of its greatest strength: niche expertise, faster decision making, and flexibility.  Oftentimes, these intrinsic advantages allow small businesses to achieve more with less while
maintaining greater intimacy with external stakeholders than larger companies."

#### Strategy for success
In the last post, we asked a question of how can a small business or a consultant with limited resources and immature ad hoc processes compete with large enterprises with greater resources and
well-defined processes for large projects.   Unsurprisingly, some competitive strategies a small business can adopt are also some of its greatest strength: niche expertise, faster decision making, and
flexibility.  Oftentimes, these intrinsic advantages allow small businesses to achieve more with less while maintaining greater intimacy with external stakeholders than larger companies.

#### Niche expertise

Almost always, the consultant's expertise would be the deciding factor for success.  A small business or a consultant usually offers expertise in a particular specific field where their experience and
knowledge gives them a distinct advantage over the competitors.  For example, the company I am currently involved with can deliver new versions of our feature-rich pharmacy management product in short
iterations because it is led by a 30 year industry professional who has unparalleled expertise in delivering Pharmanet software in British Columbia.  Moreover, we are supported by pharmacists who advise
us and provide their industry-specific perspective.

In the previous article, I implied that larger projects are done by larger teams.  This is not always true.  Quite often, a large project can be achieved with a relatively small team,
given that the team consists of industry experts.  For example, in healthcare, many large Electronical Medical Records projects are successfully tackled on by small healthcare professional driven
businesses with expert analysts having many years of experience in HL7 and medical records.  In EMR projects, external stakeholders are often other healthcare professionals, and having an industry
expert at the helm enhances the company's credibility and allows the business to better solve that industry's knowledge domain-specific problems.

#### Flexibility and faster decision making
In large companies, especially with a strong functional organization, a project manager is often limited in how much they are able to do.  Additional resources are negotiated with functional managers,
and, oftentimes, the project lead does not have control over the project budget.  Decisions, such as important change requests that affect scope and budget, are often beyond project manager's
control, thus slowing and predetermining the responses to these changes.

On the other hand, a consultant usually has full control over their small business resources and can offer options to external stakeholders which are sometimes not possible in a large business.  For instance, 
a project lead in control of their company can allow their customer to increase scope while increasing project budget in an execution phase of the project.  While traditionally, this is a bad practice called
scope creep, in certain cases the scope changes are inevitable, especially when driven by external factors.  For example, if the aforementioned consultant is executing a project which delivers software
that must pass government compliance testing, then a major change in compliance requirements could involve a significant re-make of software features and increased scope.  In such case, an expert
self-employed project lead could relatively quickly evaluate these changes and make an appropriate decision without having to wait for an approval from senior management, while enhancing their relationship
with the customer.

Finally, businesses employing smaller, expert-based teams also have an advantage because less communication channels exist between team members.  Less channels means simpler and more complete
control of all project communication.  Smaller size of the team also helps the integrity of the original message and reduces the risk of "broken telephone".  Thus, the smaller team implies simpler and 
more flexible communication planning.

#### Final words
So, are we convinced that a self-employed consultant can compete with a large business for a large project?  The answer is a frustrating maybe.  Situationally, if the project is fully within the domain
knowledge of the consultant, then their chances of success are significantly higher.  On the other hand, larger projects involving several knowledge domains are probably better handled by larger
organizations with available resources in every necessary area of expertise. 

In any case, larger projects require significant project management knowledge, regardless of the size of the business.  This knowledge allows a project manager to plan the project better and mitigate risk.
For example, I mentioned above how a small business can better react to changing government compliance requirements during the execution phase of the project.  However, this advantage is nullified by
better planning.  Changing government requirements is a risk which can be foreseen by an experienced project leader.  From the very start of the project, a contingency budget reserve can be established
to deal with such changes, thus eliminating the need for improvisation on the fly.  Thus, even a small business should strive to increase their process knowledge if they want to grow and take on sizeable
projects.
