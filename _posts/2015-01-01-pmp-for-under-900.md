excerpt: "Given you have necessary experience, Project Management Institute's PMP exam also requires you to obtain 35 hours of project management education.  While that does not seem like much, 
project management courses at traditional institutions to earn those required hours could run into thousands of dollars.  Since it is the experience that makes PMP holders stand out from the crowd,
I suggest using simple online courses and material to get your PMP in the most cost effective way.  It only makes sense to obtain the same end result with the least investment."

#### Optimize ROI
Given you have necessary experience, Project Management Institute's PMP exam also requires you to obtain 35 hours of project management education.  While that does not seem like much, 
project management courses to earn those required hours usually cost over a thousand dollars at traditional educational institutions.  Since it is the experience that makes PMP holders stand out 
from the crowd, I suggest using simple online courses and material to get your PMP in the most cost effective way available.  In the end, you will get the same result with the least investment.

#### Online courses
Simplilearn offers [self-learning course](http://www.simplilearn.com/project-management/pmp-certification-training-online/ppa630da30) with required 35 hours of project management education for $199. 
In addition, Simplilearn offers [5 PMP simulation exams](http://www.simplilearn.com/project-management/pmp-certification-training-practice-test/ppa193da30) for $15. Take those as well. 
PMP exam questions often include real-life project situations, and doing as many practice questions as possible will help you get the feel for what to expect from the exam and train your brain to
automatically filter out incorrect answers.

#### Other studying materials
Simplilearn courses and Project Management Institute's body of knowledge will probably not be enough to adequately prepare for the PMP exam.  For detailed explanation of PMP material and exercises
which will help you prepare, I recommend buying excellent [Rita Mulcahy's PMP Exam Prep book](http://www.amazon.com/PMP-Exam-Prep-Eighth-Edition/dp/1932735658) which costs between $60-$80 on Amazon. 

#### PMI membership first
By registering with Project Management Institute and paying $129 annual fee prior to registering and paying for PMP exam, you save 150 dollars.  Discounted exam cost is $405 as opposed to 
regular cost of $555.  As an additional bonus, PMI website has a handy tool for entering and calculating your required experience which can help you determine whether you qualify 
for the PMP exam and provides Christopher Scordo's _PMP Exam Prep Questions, Answers, & Explanations_ for free in ereads and reference section.  

#### All-in cost
Given a serious self-studying effort, the above material will prepare you to pass PMP exam just as well, if not better, than any project management course you take at your local college. 
Your total cost would then be:

- [Simplilearn self-learning course](http://www.simplilearn.com/project-management/pmp-certification-training-online/ppa630da30) - $199
- [Simplilearn 5 PMP simulation exams](http://www.simplilearn.com/project-management/pmp-certification-training-practice-test/ppa193da30) - $15
- [Rita Mulcahy's PMP Exam Prep](http://www.amazon.com/PMP-Exam-Prep-Eighth-Edition/dp/1932735658) - $70
- Christopher Scordo's PMP Exam Prep Questions, Answers, & Explanations - FREE!
- PMI membership - $129
- PMP exam - $405

For a grand total of 818 dollars.  Good luck with your studies!
