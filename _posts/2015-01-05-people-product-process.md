excerpt: "Oftentimes, smaller businesses using agile approach to projects are big on people and product, but tend to make up processes as they go along.  For instance, the planning phase of a small software 
project could be as simple as sitting down with the customer and writing some user stories, and execution phase would then be giving those user stories to developers to code.  The control would consist
of showing the customer intermediate releases hoping that the programmers hit the mark.  Thus, a consultant could successfully complete a smaller project using this loose process that they created by
relying on their subject matter expertise and heroics, as often happens in real life."

#### Keeping it small
Oftentimes, smaller businesses using agile approach to projects are big on people and product, but tend to make up processes as they go along.  For instance, the planning phase of a small software 
project could be as simple as sitting down with the customer and writing some user stories, and execution phase would then be giving those user stories to developers to code.  The control would consist
of showing the customer intermediate releases hoping that the programmers hit the mark.  Thus, a consultant could successfully complete a smaller project using this loose process that they created by
relying on their subject matter expertise and heroics, as often happens in real life.  

Surprisingly or not, such approach is often advantageous to a customer, since this process is actually tailored to the customer's needs.  The customer is continuously involved in the project planning 
and control, allowing the project leader to judge customer satisfaction and make adjustments on the fly. The customer is also able to make suggestions and see the project deliverables taking shape,
thus eliminating negative surprises.

Moreover, by skipping managerial deliverables, such as work breakdown structure or responsibility assignment matrix, altogether a in small project, a project lead could oftentimes increase efficiency 
by reducing management effort. This is especially useful if the project lead participates in the development herself.  If the consultant is able to run the project in their head and has a highly 
experienced development team who know their roles, focusing on coding the project deliverables as soon as possible could be a viable and sometimes more efficient approach than traditional project 
management practice to completing smaller projects.

However, a project-oriented small business eventually wants to grow and be able to handle larger projects.  This raises several questions.  Is it viable for those agile small businesses to successfully 
deliver larger projects with more stakeholders involved using ad hoc planning processes?   Is it possible for a consultant and a project lead to remain "hands on"?  What are the strategies a small
business could use to compete for large project contracts with bigger enterprises?

#### Managing project stakeholders
A small project could have a single external customer who is also a project sponsor.  Reporting the project progress in that case is easy, and could be as simple as sending out regular emails.  This 
kind of reporting does not require much planning, and could be easily handled ad hoc.

But what if we increase the size of the project to where it draws significant organizational resources and has interest from several people?  Suddenly, besides updating a 
project sponsor, a project manager has to figure out how to manage various people's expectations and communication preferences, and negotiate resources with functional managers.  Thus, managing 
stakeholders becomes an essential part of planning the project.

Increased number of stakeholders also requires a project leader to plan change control.  With a single stakeholder-customer, all change requests would come from one source and could be dealt with 
immediately by the project lead.  On the other hand, with multiple stakeholders, change request will come from different sources and often be in conflict with one another.  Thus, a decision-making 
committee is often required consisting of project stakeholders and team members to approve or reject changes.  Planning such change control further adds to the project lead's responsibilities.

#### Adding team members
A project manager could fairly easily track three people working on a two months $50K project through regular communication with each team member. Three communication channels
lead to the project manager within a team (one to each team member).  However, each of the team members also communicates with one another, increasing the number of total communication
channels to six (three within a team, three with a project manager).  Still, the total amount of communication that could pass through these channels is manageable and might not require any process 
to control it.

Let's now look at what happens when a project manager has to communicate to six team members instead.  Besides six channels leading to the project manager, 
there are 15 other channels between team members, bringing the total to 21.  Thus, doubling the size of the team resulted in more than tripling the amount of communication channels through which more 
than triple amount of information could pass.  

As we can see, the amount of potential information passed through team communications grows exponentially with team size.  After a certain point, a project manager simply would not have enough time 
during the day to control progress of the project through ad hoc communication, and needs to plan communication strategy within a team ahead of time.  Thus, planning the communication process 
becomes increasingly more important with a larger team size.
