#### Problem Statement

In an effort to provide a more accurate medical record, BC government initiated a program which allowed pharmacists to bill for reviewing patient's medication history.  Initially, many pharmacists 
performed a medication review with a patient manually and inefficiently.  

#### Project Description 

The module is developed in .NET, and consists of the following components:

- data exchange with SQL server and WinRx software,
- .NET user interface,
- and Active Reports.

#### Project Outcomes
WinMMR software is currently deployed at hundreds of customer sites where pharmacists use it daily to perform electronic medication reviews.
