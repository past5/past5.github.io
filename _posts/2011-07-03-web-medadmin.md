#### Problem Statement

Nursing procedures at many care homes are inefficient.  For example, recording scheduled medications given out to patients, reporting, and other day-to-day repetitive tasks are done manually. 
Furthermore, data exchanges between care homes and their dispensing pharmacies are often inaccurate due to human errors.

#### Project Description 

I wrote Medadmin System on pharmacy client's request in order to assist nurses with giving out daily scheduled medications, recording patients' pain and reactions, and reporting in a care home 
environment.  The online medadmin software is developed in .NET, and consists of the following components:

- SQL Server database,
- ASP.NET Web Services,
- .NET Web User Interface,
- and Crystal Reports.

#### Project Outcomes
The Medadmin system was deployed at a client site, but a decision was made to proceed with os-based software instead of this web-based product.
